Home-Is.In
==========

Home Is.In is a personal and experimental online project based off my family's concepts of home. It is meant to be a reading experience that expresses the dispersed, entangled, yet somehow unified manner of our interactions. 

Designed and compiled by Chelsea Wang under the advice of Jan Fairbairn for Typography III during Spring 2014. This website is typeset using Aper√ßu Medium and uses code from OkFocus. Brought to reality with the assistance of Charles Yeh and support from my family.
